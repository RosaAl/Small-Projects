Hello, welcome to the Small-Projects repo. Most of these projects have been created as part of my learning of Python and SQL, and are therefore, beginner friendly.

The Star Wars project was my first ever Python creation and I still enjoy playing with it, for better use of coding concepts, please see the Mini Library Project.

Please refer to specific folder for individual instructions and READMEs - note that some will have all necessary instructions directly in the codefiles.

Moving forward I am planning more personal projects specialising in data science and analytics, so will therefore be using Jupyter Notebooks. Please check back regularly for any new updates.
